This PR adds a complete `.gitignore` tailored for the PRISM_Engine project.

Purpose:
- Prevent large datasets, temporary files, and machine-specific junk from being committed
- Keep repository size small and structure clean
- Protect accidental uploads of environments, logs, and checkpoints

Key exclusions:
- Raw and normalized data folders (except README placeholders)
- Python cache files
- Jupyter notebook checkpoints
- Local environment directories (.env, env/, .venv)
- OS-generated junk files
- Zip archives, logs, and temporary scratch files
- IDE-specific folders (VS Code, JetBrains)
